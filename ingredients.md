Instructions


USE OF INGREDIENTS

Milk: Liquid activates the yeast. Whole milk is a must for the most tender dough– or you can try buttermilk. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the doughnuts aren’t as flavorful or rich.

Yeast: You can use active dry yeast or instant yeast. If using an instant yeast, your rise time will be a little shorter.

Sugar: Sugar sweetens the doughnuts, but it also feeds the yeast, increases its activity, and tenderizes the dough.

Eggs: Eggs provide structure and flavor.

Butter: Melted butter promises enhanced flavor.

Salt & Vanilla Extract: Both add flavor. Try using homemade vanilla extract.

Nutmeg: It adds a delicious pop of flavor!

Flour: All-purpose flour is the dough’s structure. IT IS USED TO MAKE a very soft, pillowy dough for soft, pillowy doughnuts.
